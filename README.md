# Crestron CTI-P101 Training Project – Basic Control System

This project was developed as part of the **Crestron CTI-P101** training course.  
It demonstrates the fundamentals of building a control system using **SIMPL**:

- Signal naming and routing
- Digital, analog, and serial joins
- Core programming logic blocks
- System organization and troubleshooting workflow

> **Note:** This is a **training practice project**, not a client deployment.  
> It exists to document learning and demonstrate foundational Crestron programming concepts.
